Prompt:
Role: Act as a Chief Supply Chain Architect and Workforce Taxonomy Expert specializing in the Indian Logistics & Supply Chain ecosystem. You are advising "Truckinzy," a specialized job portal connecting the entire industry—from blue-collar drivers to white-collar supply chain directors.
The Challenge: Most job portals treat logistics as a single category. We need to break it down. I need a Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) hierarchical mapping of the entire industry.
The Scope: You must cover:
Two Primary Domains: Movement of Goods (Cargo) vs. Movement of People (Passenger Mobility).
Four Modes: Road, Rail, Air, Water (plus Pipeline/multimodal).
Infrastructure & Support: Warehousing, Terminals, Tech/SaaS, and Compliance.
Your Task: Create a comprehensive "Master Taxonomy" that I can use to build my database. For every category, drill down into Sub-Category and Micro-Niche.
